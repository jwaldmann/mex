Prerequisites:

Haskell compiler: ghc  http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

Haskell platform: http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/
   you don't need the full platform.
   cabal-install can download and install extra packages
      http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal-Install

packages from the Yesod project (wai, warp): 
   the exact names and versions are in the .cabal file.
   currently (Jan 2012) you need to build from source,
   but they should appear on hackage after a while
   http://www.yesodweb.com/


Build:

   in theory, it is as simple as this:

   cabal install

   it will put executables  mex-server  and  mex-client
   into /usr/local/bin  or whereever your .cabal/config
   says they should go.
